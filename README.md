# Final-Year-Project
Note: This was built completely for educational purposes as part of my final year project.

Educational Web Application/Tool on How to Build a Computer.

This site is built to teach people how to build a computer from the ground up.

The site includes three pages, the first is the information page that includes details about each important part.

The second page is the build page that includes drag and drop features and a quiz to provide an interactive feature to the user.

Finally, the last page is the create page that allows the user to draft a computer system from real life parts.

Note: Some videos here won't work as there was not enough space to store them in this repos. These will all be embedded eventually.
